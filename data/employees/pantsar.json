    "cv": "Markus Pantsar iss a guest professor at the chair of Prof. Dr. Gabriele Gramelsberger (Theory of Science and Technology). In 2017, he received the Title of Docent from the University of Helsinki. He worked as a Senior Grant Researcher in Theoretical Philosophy at the Faculty of Arts, University of Helsinki, Finland from 2019 to 2021. Before that he worked in several projects as a postdoctoral researcher from 2010 to 2018. His research has focused on empirically-informed epistemology of mathematics. In addition, he has worked on computational modeling of cognitive processes involved in mathematics and their complexity. Most recently, his research focus has moved toward artificial intelligence and its potential for mathematics. Between 2013 and 2014, he was a Visiting Researcher at the Munich Center for Mathematical Philosophy, Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität München, Germany. Between 2021 and 2022 he was a Senior Fellow at the Käte Hamburger Kolleg Aachen: Cultures of Research. He has published articles in many important international journals, including Synthese, Erkenntnis, Minds and Machines, Philosophia Mathematica. Topoi, Theoria and Frontiers in Psychology.",
