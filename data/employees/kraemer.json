She studied Literature and Philosophy at RWTH Aachen, Germany and at Hacettepe University in Ankara, Turkey. Her Master’s thesis deals with the topic “On the Ontology of Literary Works”. In the course of working as a journalist for different media institutions for several years, she has confronted different ethical issues. In this vein, her dissertation focused on the question, “Does reality TV hurt human dignity?”. Here she develops an understanding of dignity and examines what this means for considering ethical issues in reality TV-shows. Her next project deals with reflections on media and ethical responsibility. Besides this, she is interested in animal ethics and environmental ethics. Together with Prof. Simone Paganini and Prof. Wulf Kellerwessel, she founded the Centre of Human-Animal Studies Aachen (CHASA).",
