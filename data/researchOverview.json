                "Our research is dedicated to the understanding of the \"radical transformation of the nature of science\" through digitalization (EU Horizon 2020). The aim is twofold: On the one hand, we are developing a conceptual framework for a Philosophy of Computational Sciences and Technology; on the other, we are building an open science infrastructure for Computational Science Studies. We are programming software tools designed to facilitate case studies on computational sciences in the subfield of code studies.",

In 2018 and 2019 the CSS Lab received funding from the DFG Initiative of Excellence and the the Stifterverband and the Ministry of Innovation, Science and Research of North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW Digital Fellowship 2017)"
