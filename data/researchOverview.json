                "Our research is dedicated to the understanding of the transformation of the nature of science through digitalization and the increasing use of machine learning and artificial intelligence in scientific disciplines. The aim is twofold: On the one hand, we are developing a conceptual framework for a Philosophy of Computational Sciences and Technology; on the other, we are building an open science infrastructure for Computational Science Studies. We are programming software tools designed to facilitate case studies on computational sciences in the subfield of code studies.",
                "The CSS Lab was founded in 2017. It is part of the Chair for Theory of Science and Technology at the RWTH Human Technology Center. In 2018, 2019 and 2020 the CSS Lab received funding from the DFG Initiative of Excellence, also from the the Stifterverband and the Ministry of Innovation, Science and Research of North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW Digital Fellowship 2017) For more information see projects."
