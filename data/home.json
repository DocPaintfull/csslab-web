For decades now, computer-based modelling and simulation have expanded the methods of science. Today, computational departments complement their experimental and theoretical counterparts. In recent years, big data analytics and artificial intelligence, in particular machine learning, have propelled the digital transformation of science and technology. Thus, knowledge production in science and technology development have changed tremendously. Understanding these shifts is our concern."

The CSS Lab is building an infrastructure for conducting Computational Science Studies (CSS). It explores traditional Science and Technology Studies methods such as interviews, participatory observation, and text analysis for case studies. A further focus is on the investigation of new methods such as code and programming studies. In the process, software tools are developed in order to support Computational Science Studies."
