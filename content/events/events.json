    "description": "Archives, collections, labs and machine parks are well known institutions that promote scientific research. From the 19th century on they have been developing into large scale research systems organizing methods, instruments and scientists’ work. In the last decades we are witnessing that sciences have become more and more computer-based. Obviously, data centers, networks and platforms are indispensable facilities for research, they are complementing and reconfiguring traditional technologies. In a historical perspective, digital infrastructures offer an unprecedented generalizability: they stimulate the production and circulation of methodological knowledge across a broad spectrum of academic disciplines. The interdisciplinary Summer School investigates the history and philosophy of digital infrastructures. How do infrastructures affect science? And how do sciences configure their technologies?",
